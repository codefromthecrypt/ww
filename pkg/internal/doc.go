// Package internal contains unexported subpackages that are used throughout wetware.
//
// In an effort to keep the public API minimal, most packages begin their lives as an
// internal package, and are exported on an as-needed basis.  If you need access to a
// subpackage for any reason, please open an issue requesting the package's exportation
// along with a bit of context/justification.  It is very likely that we will
// accommodate your request.
